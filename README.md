# Early Vote 2020G Data

The U.S. Elections project publishes [2020 General Election early vote statistics](https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html).
The website shows detailed state statistics and analyses for reporting states but doesn't report how these statistics have changed over time.
For example, it may be interesting to see how early voter turnout has grown throughout the election.

Fortunately the 2020 General Election Early Vote Statistics website is hosted on GitHub pages.
Thus, the website code itself is on GitHub. This project is an effort to recover the underlying data from the Git history.
